We will discuss discrete-time and continuous-time dynamical systems, introduce the concept of equilibria and Lyapunov stability. An important aspect of the lecture will be to emphasize the difference between noise and structural (epistemic) uncertainty and show how uncertainty can be reduced with feedback. We will also discuss connections to game theory and generalization (Lecture 1).</description></item><item><title>A brief overview of game theory</title><link>https://beyond-iid-learning.xyz/lectures/lecture-02/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beyond-iid-learning.xyz/lectures/lecture-02/</guid><description>The lecture will summarize key ideas in game theory. Game theory provides a means for modelling interactions between machine learning algorithms and their environment. We will revisit zero-sum games and von Neumann’s minimax theorem and introduce the concept of Nash equilibria. We will then discuss repeated games and adaptive decision-making algorithms (follow the leader, follow a random leader, multiplicative weights).</description></item><item><title>A brief overview of statistical learning theory</title><link>https://beyond-iid-learning.xyz/lectures/lecture-01/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beyond-iid-learning.xyz/lectures/lecture-01/</guid><description>The lecture will summarize the main ideas of statistical learning theory. We will revisit the standard generalization bounds that characterize the difference between true and empirical risk. We will critically discuss the underlying assumptions and show examples where these are violated. We will also discuss the dependence of the bounds on the number of parameters, which is important for understanding the success of overparametrization in today’s machine learning practice.</description></item><item><title>Announcements</title><link>https://beyond-iid-learning.xyz/announcements/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beyond-iid-learning.xyz/announcements/</guid><description>Announcements Aug 3 The first meeting (in which we will discuss organizational matters) will take place on September 22, 2021 at 17:30.

Abstract: Many machine learning problems go beyond supervised learning on independent data points and require an understanding of the underlying causal mechanisms, the interactions between the learning algorithms and their environment, and adaptation to temporal changes. The course highlights some of these challenges and relates them to state-of-the-art research.
Objective: The goal of this seminar is to gain experience with machine learning research and foster interdisciplinary thinking.</description></item><item><title>TBA</title><link>https://beyond-iid-learning.xyz/lectures/lecture-06/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beyond-iid-learning.xyz/lectures/lecture-06/</guid><description>TBA</description></item><item><title>TBA</title><link>https://beyond-iid-learning.xyz/lectures/lecture-07/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beyond-iid-learning.xyz/lectures/lecture-07/</guid><description>TBA</description></item><item><title>TBA</title><link>https://beyond-iid-learning.xyz/lectures/lecture-08/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beyond-iid-learning.xyz/lectures/lecture-08/</guid><description>TBA</description></item><item><title>TBA</title><link>https://beyond-iid-learning.xyz/lectures/lecture-09/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beyond-iid-learning.xyz/lectures/lecture-09/</guid><description>TBA</description></item><item><title>TBA</title><link>https://beyond-iid-learning.xyz/lectures/lecture-10/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beyond-iid-learning.xyz/lectures/lecture-10/</guid><description>TBA</description></item><item><title>TBA</title><link>https://beyond-iid-learning.xyz/lectures/lecture-11/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beyond-iid-learning.xyz/lectures/lecture-11/</guid><description>TBA</description></item><item><title>TBA</title><link>https://beyond-iid-learning.xyz/lectures/lecture-12/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beyond-iid-learning.xyz/lectures/lecture-12/</guid><description>TBA</description></item></channel></rss>
