The lecture will summarize key ideas in game theory. 
Game theory provides a means for modelling interactions between machine learning algorithms and their environment. 
We will revisit zero-sum games and von Neumannâ€™s minimax theorem and introduce the concept of Nash equilibria. 
We will then discuss repeated games and adaptive decision-making algorithms (follow the leader, follow a random leader, multiplicative weights).
