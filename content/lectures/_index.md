On this page, you will find an overview of the lectures and the materials that we plan to cover in the seminar.
For each week, we also list some recommended preparatory reading that you should read *before* the lecture.

In case you want to add the lectures to your calendar, [we are providing an ICS file](/lectures/index.ics) to which you can subscribe (e.g., ```File``` â†’ ```New Calendar Subscription``` in the default Calendar app on macOS).
