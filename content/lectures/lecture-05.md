The lecture will summarize the basics of dynamical systems and control theory. 
We will discuss discrete-time and continuous-time dynamical systems, introduce the concept of equilibria and Lyapunov stability. 
An important aspect of the lecture will be to emphasize the difference between noise and structural (epistemic) uncertainty and show how uncertainty can be reduced with feedback. 
We will also discuss connections to game theory and generalization (Lecture 1).
