Stein’s method is a powerful tool from probability theory for bounding the distance between probability distributions. 
In this talk, I will describe how this tool designed to prove central limit theorems can be adapted to assess and improve the quality of practical inference procedures. 
Along the way, I will highlight applications to Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler selection, goodness-of-fit testing, variational inference, de novo sampling, post-selection inference, and non-convex optimization, and close with several opportunities for future work.
