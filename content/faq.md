# Frequently Asked Questions

In this section, we will collect frequently asked questions as well as the answers. Please check the FAQ before contacting the lecturers or TAs about a question.



## I have a question — who should I contact?
If your question concerns the exam, please get in touch with [Maximilian Mordig](http://www.is.mpg.de/person/mmordig). 
In case you have noticed an issue with the website (e.g., something is broken or not up-to-date), email [Timothy Gebhard](https://timothygebhard.com) or create an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/beyond-iid-learning/beyond-iid-learning.github.io).
For other, more specific questions, please get in touch with [Michael Muehlebach](https://sites.google.com/view/mmuehlebach/).


## Will the lecture slides / recordings be made available?
On the condition that the respective lecturer agrees to it, we will make the slides (or notes) of a talk available on the course website.
The same is true for the lecture recordings, which will be published on the [ETH video portal](https://video.ethz.ch/) (requires an ETH login).

## Where can I discuss my questions / thoughts with other participants?
We have added a [Moodle forum](https://moodle-app2.let.ethz.ch/course/view.php?id=16236) (requires an ETH login) for this purpose.
Please note that we currently do not plan to monitor this forum regularly.
This means that if you want an quick answer from a lecturer / TA, you should still contact us directly.
