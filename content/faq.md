## Will the lecture slides / recordings be made available?
On the condition that the respective lecturer agrees to it, we will make the slides (or notes) of a talk available on the course website.
The same is true for the lecture recordings, which will be published on the [ETH video portal](https://video.ethz.ch/) (requires a login).
